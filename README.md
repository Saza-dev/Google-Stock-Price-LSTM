# Google Stock Price Prediction with LSTM

A simple Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network built with TensorFlow/Keras to predict Google stock prices based on historical data.
This is a beginner deep learning project focused on learning the fundamentals of time series forecasting using LSTMs.

This project demonstrates how to:
 - Load and preprocess stock price data
 - Build and train an LSTM model using Keras (TensorFlow backend)
 - Evaluate the model performance on test data
 - Make future stock price predictions
